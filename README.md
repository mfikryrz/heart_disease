# heart disease prediction

Mapping Dataset: This step helped me gain insights into the data and identify key features for the prediction model.

Preprocessing Dataset: To ensure the dataset's quality and reliability, I performed preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and normalizing the data. 

Split Dataset: To evaluate the model's performance effectively, I split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Modeling Dataset: Using a deep learning algorithm, I constructed a predictive model that could identify the presence or absence of heart disease based on the input features.

Improvement Dataset Accuracy: To optimize the accuracy of the model, I fine-tuned the hyperparameters, experimented with different architectures, and performed feature engineering.
